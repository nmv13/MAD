It was good to get a refresher on Encapsulation and Polymorphism. The examples in the book about the blender helped
a lot with my understanding of the two. 

I still don't fully understand what Prototype chaining is.

Mixin is a concept I have never heard of before at least in C++ Object-Oriented Programming. From what I can
gather, it is a different way of basically making an object have specific properties of another object without
full-blown inheriting the whole thing. Is that correct?

I didn't fully understnad "that" either. Is "that" some sort of reserved variable or function, because it didn't
seem like that from the book, yet it was very adiment that the specific word "that" is what you need to use for 
the circumstance where "this" is involved.
