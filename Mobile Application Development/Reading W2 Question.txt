I went through chapters 2-4, most of which was review but there were a few things that were new. The one question I have however, is about memory leaks as mentioned in chapter 3. I am familiar with that subject from other programming classes, but never fully understood what it was. In this textbook, it describes a leak as a program that has memory storing values that are no longer required. I can understand how that would be a problem with pointers and arrays because they are bigger/more specific values, but other than that, I am unaware of any kind of stored value having a "delete" command like there are in certain cases of C++. 

Now in JavaScript apparently there are "weak" variables that fix this issue, but if that's the solution, wouldn't it be necessary for all variables to be "weak"? I have always been under the impression that the instant a program goes outside a given scope, unless there was a value in initiated in the scope that is "static" or something, the program automatically deletes it anyway, meaning any "weak" variables aren't really that important and a memory leak would never be a problem. The more I read about it the less I felt I understood, or I'm just overthinking it, I don't know.
