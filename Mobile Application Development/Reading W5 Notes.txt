I never knew there was a "finally" block as fat of "try/catch". I undrstand that it's 
meant have a (regardless of the putcome, do this) type functionality, but why wouldn't
you just put whatever that is above the try/catch part? I can see why wouldn't below
because anything after that catch may not execute if there was an exception, but why
not the top?

Also, I still don't really understand what "jest" is specifically meant for. The only 
benefit I understand is debugging multipul files at once, but especially if there were 
multipule errors on each file, wouldn't that make debugging a bit harder?
